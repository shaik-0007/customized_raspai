Recipient Information:**\n\n*   **Recipient's Email Address:** Who are you sending the email to?  (e.g., `john.doe@example.com`)\n*   **(Optional) Recipient's Name:**  Just for the email itself to address the person.\n*   **(Optional) CC (Carbon Copy):**  Do you want to send a copy to anyone else?  If so, provide their email addresses.\n*   **(Optional) BCC (Blind Carbon Copy):**  Do you want to send a copy to anyone else without them being visible to the other recipients? If so, provide their email addresses.\n\n**2. Content of the Email:**\n\n*   **Subject:** What is the subject of your email?  (e.g., `Meeting Confirmation`, `Project Update`, `Hello!`)\n*   **Body:** What do you want to say in the email?  (The actual message itself.)\n*   **(Optional) Attachments:**  Do you want to include any files (e.g., documents, pictures, etc.)?  If so, please tell me:\n    *   The filenames (if you have the files in the same place where I am)\n    *   Or I can ask for you to give me the file for me to upload it\n\n**Example of how to give me the information:**\n\n\"Please send an email to `jane.smith@email.com` with the subject `Job Application`.  The body of the email should say: 'Dear Ms. Smith, I am writing to express my interest in the open position at your company.  My resume is attached. Thank you for your time.' I'll provide the file when you ask for it.\"\n\n**Then:**\n*   I will ask for your attachment.\n\n**Once you give me the information, I will generate the email,** but I cannot *actually send* the email from my current location or environment. I will provide you with the generated email text, including the necessary headers, so you can then:\n\n*   **Copy and paste the generated text into your email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)** to send the email.\n\n**Ready to get started? Just provide me with the information requested above.**\n"
